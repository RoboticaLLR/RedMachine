# Introduction
We have made our biggest effort on doing the best robot we could. This has been really long road and it helped us a lot on things like programation, mechanical and design. After a lot of thinking and analyzing we have created out own stategy based on the electronical components we had, 
fervently believing that it will have a good performance in this edition of the WRO.

# Mechanical Design

The design of the robot is one of the biggest problem we have faced, we didnt have any idea on how to do a chassis, because we didnt have any kit or help, so we reused a acrylic base from a previous competition, and even thought the acrylic base did not work, it gave us a idea on how to make the base of the chassis. This phase was the 
definitely the hardest because we didnt have any help from anyone, and we didnt have any clue about how to start. 

Since this moment we focus on doing the chassis based on the requirements we will need in the future, such as the size and weight because we knew it may be a probblem in the future. so we cut the acrylic to the size using diferent tools, 
however as we did it for ourselves it had lots of imperfections on the holes we made, so it gave us lots of problems in the future, because it required us to be symetric and it wasnt. But because we dont have any better option at the moment and we had a regional competition very soon we leave that like that.




After doing our first base of the chassis, we started looking for a way to add a traction and a direction system because the rules were really specific about it, and we really focus on doing it, also we made all the spaces for the electronical componenetes such as the arduino, bridge H and sensors. At this moment we realized the asymetrical the acrylic was, but we were really in a hurry because of the competition and we aplied some 
momentary fixes to it. But overall the robot was doing a good performance and he started to score some points
